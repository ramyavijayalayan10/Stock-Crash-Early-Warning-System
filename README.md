## 🚀 Overview

This project blends technical market data with NLP-based sentiment scoring to deliver a scalable **Early Warning System**. It identifies high-risk setups based on historical stock behavior, enriched by recent news sentiment to improve decision context.

- 🔍 Historical pattern detection for 7 US stocks *(MAANG + Microsoft + Tesla)* and 3 Indian stocks *(Reliance, Infosys Ltd, HDFC Bank)* 
- 🧠 Machine Learning-driven crash prediction using technical indicators
- 📰 Real-time news scraping and sentiment scoring from **Finviz** and **Economic Times**
- 📊 Fully interactive dashboard built in **Power BI** to visualize risk triggers and sentiment-weighted alerts

---

## 🧠 Methodology Highlights

- Stock data collected via `yfinance` spanning **5 years**
- Modeled short-term market inflection points using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - **XGBoost** *(final choice—best performance)*
- Crash flags and probabilities calibrated on features like:
  - `RSI_14`, `Volatility`, `MACD`, `MA_20`, `MA_50`, `Volume Surge`, `Max Drawdown_30`, `Daily Returns`, etc.

> Instead of predicting a literal crash for "today," the system evaluates if current conditions **resemble historical setups** that **typically preceded downturns within 15–30 days**.

### 📰 Sentiment Module

- Headlines fetched for each stock from curated sources
- Scored using `vaderSentiment.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`
- Weighted into final risk scores to reflect public mood alongside technical signals

### 🚨 Alert Logic
Alerts are triggered when:
- Crash Probability ≥ 70%
- Sentiment Score ≤ -0.5
- Volume spike ≥ 2× average
- Price drop ≥ 5% in 1 day”
